Apart from the core services, we develop tooling and automation to improve our efficiency and gain more time to innovate. We work with all major train, bus and ferry operators in Europe (and beyond) and strive to create a travel product that none of them can build in isolation. Our ambition is to disrupt the way people search for and book travel.

You pick the right tool for the job and your mindset is not limited to a single paradigm or language. You know how to write tests and validate that your code does what it is supposed to do.
Pragmatic: You can take on complex multi-domain problems, analyze, design, build modular solutions, and deliver end-to-end in an MVP, value-first and iterative approach. You know that sometimes you need to cut corners and are able to foresee the effects of it. You also understand that software engineering is not always just fun and you are willing to put in the effort to get things done even if they are sometimes somewhat boring.
An automator: You strive to remove repetition and snowflakes through scripting and automation tools. You have deployed, monitored, and supported applications in production environments.

Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Aerospike, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.

The Opportunity:

You might call yourself “full stack” or “back end” or you might consider yourself an authority in a certain field, but you will have a keen interest in how the different systems work together.

We’d love to hear from you if you are experienced in any of the technologies we work with (note – we are not looking for you to have them all). We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from individuals just starting their IT careers to experts in their field.

In this Role, you’ll get to:

As an engineer we like you to think about the full life cycle of our products, and not just about a single piece of code
From customer requirements, technology selection to coding standards, agile development, unit and application testing

What you’ll Need to Succeed:

Scala, C# or Java. You might have experience in other languages but are confident you can learn
Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment

In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices.

We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 2.5 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 4,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

Get to Know Our Team

In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices.

Design, develop and maintain platforms across the back end area
Improve scalability, stability, and efficiency of our existing systems
Write great code and help others write great code
Collaborate with other teams and departments

Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements

Excellent verbal and written English communication skills

It’s Great If You Have

Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies

Are you a leading technical expert who enjoys creating and scaling software products? Do you thrive in high-paced environments where you are in the driver’s seat for continuous quality improvements? If you have devoted your last decade to architecting software with enterprise-scale, we challenge you to spend the next decade building apps with web-scale!

At Trilogy, we believe cloud-native engines power the future of enterprise software. We take full advantage of highly scalable, distributed databases - you even have the chance to work with the author of The DynamoDB Book! We also leverage the most advanced technologies provided by AWS and build our products directly on top - this allows us to take any legacy software product and rewrite it for the public cloud within 5k lines of code!

Leading with your technical expertise: You will guide the team with the software development experience you’ve gained over the years, pointing them in the right direction on the most complex challenges and newest technologies.
Spending one day per week digging deep into the product: By getting your hands dirty with the architecture and coding challenges, you will draw technical insights on how to move them to web-scale.
What You Won’t Be Doing
Project managing the work of low-level managers. We lead by doing, not by being hands-off.
Overseeing steady-state operations. Our culture is continuous improvement. You will never stop improving quality and productivity with deep knowledge and hard evidence.

Senior Software Engineer,Shouf,"Cairo, Egypt",20:19.6,Full-time,,,7,"Shouf is a platform for booking unique experiences hosted by passionate locals. You can download the app from the App Store or Play Store. Shouf’s mission is empower passionate locals with the technology needed to reach more people and make a sustainable living. If you're into high-quality tools and next-level infrastructure at a large scale, read on!

We're hiring a senior software engineer to join our small team of A+ people and build the foundations of Shouf. Email us at careers@shouf.co

Why join

As a small team, we work in a highly collaborative environment and you'll have the opportunity to participate in every part of the business from idea to production.

Impact: Build the foundation and shape engineering practices, team, and company culture.
Excellence: Practice your craft with other engineers in a well-organized, fast-paced environment.
Ownership: Influence the direction of product and strategy — we care about your opinions.
What you'll do (responsibilities)

We're looking for an individual with the right learning mindset who enjoys working alongside other engineers and designers to quickly build and iterate on backend/frontend/API/platform.

Build the people to people experiences platform. You'll build the infrastructure for Shouf from the ground up, having a huge and direct impact by shipping your work to users on prod daily.
Use modern web tech and influence the stack. The frontend is React, the (still minimal) backend Node. As we build out our stack, you get to make critical choices and lay the foundations.
Self-direct your work and co-own the product. You're a technical founder type and will have autonomy and responsibility. You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and will own Shouf’s exploding backend needs.
Create a robust and scalable backend
Build UI components. You'll implement basic UI based on existing mocks and our design system. You'll collaborate with designers and software engineers on user-facing features powered by your backend code. We rapidly ship UI that has a native feel to it by polishing CSS, interaction states, and animations.
Solve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve super-challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 3rd party integrations, syncing app state, to real-time collaboration.

What we're looking for (qualifications)

You have experience building such systems before and this is not an area you have to ramp up on. We don't require any formal qualifications but value learning new skills — especially from one another. We are looking for someone that feels a sense of duty to the users of their work.

Highly productive while producing quality code. You enjoy pushing out features in a pragmatic and maintainable way. You know when to use duct tape and when to lay a foundation.
Curious and quick learning. We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you.
Design sensibility. While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it.
Attention to detail while pragmatic. We strive for few slips in code, Git hygiene, and clear written communication — all while remaining low-ego and simply focusing on solutions.
Interested in productivity apps/systems. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or self-optimize in other ways.
Good heart. We don't tolerate jerks and are generally just friendly people.

What we offer (compensation & benefits)

We'll treat you well. If there are any other benefits that are important to you, we'd like to hear.
Competitive salary
Paid time off — 4 weeks paid vacation and paid sick leave
Flexible Location

Recruitment Privacy Notice

As part of any recruitment process, Nagwa collects and processes personal data relating to job applicants. Nagwa is committed to being transparent about how it collects and uses that data and to meeting its data protection obligations.

What information does Nagwa collect?

Nagwa collects a range of information about you. This includes:
your name, address and contact details, including email address and telephone number;
details of your qualifications, skills, experience and employment history;
information about the date you applied, email correspondence, writing sample assessment, comments and rating;
whether or not you have a disability for which Nagwa needs to make reasonable adjustments during the recruitment process; and
information about your entitlement to work in the UK.

Nagwa collects this information in a variety of ways. For example, data might be contained in application forms, CVs or resumes, obtained from your passport or other identity documents, or collected through interviews or other forms of assessment, including online tests.

Nagwa will also collect personal data about you from third parties, such as references supplied by former employers, information from employment background check providers and information from criminal records checks. Nagwa will seek information from third parties only once a job offer to you has been made and will inform you that it is doing so.

Data will be stored in a range of different places, including on your application record, in HR management systems and on other IT systems (including email).

Why does Nagwa process personal data?

Nagwa needs to process data to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. It also needs to process your data to enter into a contract with you.

In some cases, Nagwa needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is required to check a successful applicant's eligibility to work in the UK before employment starts.

Nagwa has a legitimate interest in processing personal data during the recruitment process and for keeping records of the process. Processing data from job applicants allows Nagwa to manage the recruitment process, assess and confirm a candidate's suitability for employment and decide to whom to offer a job. Nagwa may also need to process data from job applicants to respond to and defend against legal claims.

Where Nagwa relies on legitimate interests as a reason for processing data, it has considered whether or not those interests are overridden by the rights and freedoms of employees or workers and has concluded that they are not.

Nagwa processes health information if it needs to make reasonable adjustments to the recruitment process for candidates who have a disability. This is to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.

Where Nagwa processes other special categories of data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation, health or religion or belief, this is for equal opportunities monitoring purposes.

For some roles, Nagwa is obliged to seek information about criminal convictions and offences. Where Nagwa seeks this information, it does so because it is necessary for it to carry out its obligations and exercise specific rights in relation to employment.

Nagwa will not use your data for any purpose other than the recruitment exercise for which you have applied.

If your application is unsuccessful, Nagwa may keep your personal data on file in case there are future employment opportunities for which you may be suited. Nagwa will ask for your consent before it keeps your data for this purpose and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.

Nagwa Data Controllers and Data Processors

Nagwa Limited U.K. is the data controller, along with our associated company Naqwa Technologies based in Egypt, for your personal information and content as defined by the GDPR. The policies set out in this document apply to both companies. The contact details for Nagwa Limited U.K. are set out at the end of this document.

Nagwa provides its services internationally. In accordance with GDPR requirements, all service providers are audited to check that they comply with GDPR requirements and substantially follow Nagwa's privacy policy.

To deliver the Nagwa service, we use a number of third party data processers who are contractually committed to deliver the privacy policy described in this document. These include:
Nagwa Technologies, Egypt
Amazon Data Hosting Services, USA
JazzHR, USA

Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction. This includes areas outside of the European Union. To ensure GDPR compliance Nagwa has Standard Contractual Clauses in place where necessary and U.S. Companies are registered with Privacy Shield.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

In the event that a dispute arises with regards to the international transfer of data, you agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.

Who has access to data?

Your information will be shared internally (within Nagwa Technologies) for the purposes of the recruitment exercise. This includes members of the HR and recruitment team, interviewers involved in the recruitment process, managers in the business area with a vacancy and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for the performance of their roles.

Nagwa will not share your data with third parties other than those detailed above, unless your application for employment is successful and it makes you an offer of employment. Nagwa will then share your data with former employers to obtain references for you, employment background check providers to obtain necessary background checks and the Disclosure and Barring Service to obtain necessary criminal records checks, where appropriate.

How does Nagwa protect data?

Nagwa takes the security of your data seriously. It has internal policies and controls in place to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by our employees in the proper performance of their duties. Nagwa uses encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection, and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to data. Nagwa also places internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.

For how long does Nagwa keep data?

If your application for employment is unsuccessful, Nagwa will hold your data on file for 6 months after the end of the relevant recruitment process. If you agree to allow Nagwa to keep your personal data on file, Nagwa will hold your data on file for 6 months for consideration for future employment opportunities. At the end of that period, your data is deleted or destroyed.

If your application for employment is successful, personal data gathered during the recruitment process will be transferred to your personnel file and retained during your employment. The periods for which your data will be held will be provided to you in a new privacy notice.

Your rights

As a data subject, you have a number of rights. You can:
access and obtain a copy of your data on request;
require Nagwa to change incorrect or incomplete data;
require Nagwa to delete or stop processing your data, for example where the data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing;
object to the processing of your data where Nagwa is relying on its legitimate interests as the legal ground for processing; and
ask Nagwa to stop processing data for a period if data is inaccurate or there is a dispute about whether or not your interests override Nagwa's legitimate grounds for processing data.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please email Paula Dixon at paula.dixon@nagwa.com. You can make a subject access request by completing Nagwa's form for making a subject access request.

If you believe that Nagwa has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Information Commissioner.

What if you do not provide personal data?

You are under no statutory or contractual obligation to provide data to Nagwa during the recruitment process. However, if you do not provide the information, Nagwa may not be able to process your application properly or at all.

You are under no obligation to provide information for equal opportunities monitoring purposes and there are no consequences for your application if you choose not to provide such information.

Automated decision-making

Nagwa's recruitment processes are not based solely on automated decision-making.

React Developer,Spokn,Egypt,20:52.5,Full-time,Entry level,Software Development,181,"We’re bringing podcasting to work! 🎧

We're transforming the way companies build culture and community in a remote world.

We're helping top companies like Udemy, Mixpanel, and ServiceNow tap into the power of audio to inform and engage their employees in a format they love – no zoom fatigue or scheduling problems.

Why does it matter?

Because employees do their best work when they trust their leadership, feel connected to their colleagues, understand their company’s direction, and are motivated to contribute.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?

Are you the best software architect in your company? Can you identify patterns in complex systems and see ways to make them 10x simpler? Do you enjoy designing software that maximizes the use of existing code? Do you wish you could expand your technical career without requiring more time on HR or project management? If so, you’ll love our approach of driving the direction of products starting with the core technology.

In this role, you will join a passionate and experienced team responsible for all of the important technical decisions on every product in our extensive portfolio of enterprise software solutions. You’ll spend your time making strategic technical design decisions, such as:

You will uncover the “high-order bit” decisions by interviewing other technical leads, analyzing the data structures and code/design documents.
You will make important design decisions that specify how to rearchitect products in a cloud-first way on systems such as AWS and GCP.

The Calibre xRC tool provides robust parasitic extraction that delivers accurate parasitic data for comprehensive and accurate post-layout analysis and simulation. A rule-based extraction tool reads a design layout using a two-dimensional description of the design’s physical shapes (e.g., GDSII). It then identifies patterns in the layout that match a predefined set of models in the extraction rules, performs the calculations by substituting in the actual design dimensions, and writes an extracted netlist that includes the design circuit and its extracted parasitic components. This extracted netlist is used by SPICE circuit simulators and static timing analysis (STA) tools, and those results, in turn, are used to adjust or modify the design to obtain the desired performance and/or eliminate any operational issues.

What you'll be doing
In this role, you will:
Sponsor quality process and procedures throughout the entire product lifecycle including inspections, code reviews, requirements, code coverage and quality improvement.
Set expectations for product quality, create a plan to measure the expectations, and ensure execution of the plan.

Record past verification and validation efforts to ensure reproducibility of results.
Assesses technical capability of product, including ease of use, functionality, reliability, and serviceability.
Testing product for defects and limitations, and boundaries (think of all the ways that a product might not work).
Collaborates and coordinates as needed with global engineering and QA teams.
Review functional and design specifications and other project documentation. Review internal and external product and release documentation and provide appropriate input to others, e.g. KPD, third party providers, etc.
Coordinate efforts with SW Development and Release Team members to ensure quality software releases.

Knowledge and experience needed:
B.Sc./M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Communication Engineering or Computer Engineering.
0-3 years of experience in the electronic domain preferably testing and verification.
Solid knowledge in scripting languages.
Sound knowledge in IC physical design, layout, and verification tools; and IC manufacturing process.
Familiar with Software Quality Assurance processes and software testing concepts.
Familiar with working on Linux/Unix OS.
Excellent communication skills and ability to work closely with MKT and R&D to understand software features and customer usage.

This is a contract role, offering a highly competitive salary. Although the successful candidate won't be a permanent employee, we'll follow the same principles of employment opportunity as we do with all of our permanent hiring.

We’re Siemens. A collection of over 377,000 minds building the future, one day at a time in over 200 countries.

Regional Talent Acquisition & Career Manager at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)

Médecins sans Frontières seeks for its field position:

Regional 3D Focal Point-Amman

Context of the mission:

The MSF Foundation is a specialized entity created by Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) dedicated to medical innovation targeting underserved patients and contexts. Ongoing projects include, among others, the use of 3D printing to create customized prosthetics, the development of digital tools in the fight against and surveillance of epidemics and the development of a machine learning-powered smartphone app to streamline and automate antibiotic susceptibility testing.

The MSF Foundation promotes a collaborative approach, developing specific networks and seeking out external expertise (universities, start-ups and research centers) to be shared with MSF. It helps combine the specific competences of external actors and the experience of field professionals. Its mission on behalf of MSF is to be a laboratory for innovation.

OUR MISSION AT THE 3D PROGRAM

The 3D project from The MSF Foundation aims at increasing access to rehabilitation, prosthetics & orthotics care through the design and production of devices assisted by new technologies for neglected patient populations in areas where there’s limited or no access to this specific care.
The project was initiated at the MSF Reconstructive Surgery Hospital of Amman in February 2017. We deliver cost-effective, adapted, lighter, in-house prosthetics & orthotics services based on 3D technology for patients from the whole region. The 3D program includes two main sub-projects:

- To design and manufacture customized upper limb prosthetics: According to estimations, there are as many as 40 million amputees worldwide with only 5% of them having access to prosthetic and orthotic care. Cost, access to healthcare or availability of the service are the main constraints faced by amputees especially upper limbs one and the current conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen will increase the needs for orthotics and prosthetics care in the Middle East.
- To design and manufacture Transparent Facial Orthosis (TFO) for burns victims: MSF delivers many surgical treatments and rehabilitation care to burn patients around the world, particularly in the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Haiti. Pressure therapy, particularly for facial burns, is an essential part of successful rehabilitation to treat the scarring processes. Unfortunately, access to pressure therapy for burn patients in limited resources contexts are insufficient and on-site teams are rarely qualified to make these devices.

In every field, the production of customed devices is done through the help of technologies including 3D scanning, 3D printing and telemedicine. Patient care start with a close collaboration between them and The MSF Foundation multidisciplinary team to develop solutions adapted to their needs; we assess and interview them to determine their condition and the specific activities that they would like to restore in their lives. After receiving their initial care, patients are being followed-up to ensure their rehabilitation through their long demanding conditions. As for our Middle East programs, to appropriately follow each patient is essential but challenging especially while they are spread throughout the whole region, justifying our need for a regional activity.

Main responsibilities:

As a member of The MSF Foundation 3D program Team, based in Amman, the regional 3D focal point contributes through his/her expertise to:
1. Assess resources and capacities in rehabilitation applied to the 3D project for countries with MSF activities in Middle-East.
- Explore, understand and report local capabilities in rehabilitation, 3D technologies and potential possibility to receive 3D patients for follow up and project set-up.
- Assessment needs to target in priority countries of origin of 3D patients’ programs (Iraq, Yemen).
-
2. Identify structures and key actors in those countries to establish rehabilitation care network toward 3D program activities.
- According to assessment, the 3D regional focal point will provide clear reporting to enable adapted choices of collaborative structures with the different responsible and accountable actors of the project. (MSF Foundation / Cells)
- Initiate collaboration with identified structures to enable future follow-up and treatment of 3D patients.
- Start training and provide appropriate support to selected local facilities, to enable them to receive 3D patients.

3. Enable and coordinate 3D regional patient follow-up in their home country after their treatment at RSH.
- According to previous actions, the 3D regional focal point will support local facilities to follow-up home country patients after their treatment at RSH (on-site and remotely).
- If necessary, will be responsible for the remote follow-up of those patients if no local solutions have been identified yet.

4. Enable potential care to patients in need of treatment provided by the 3D program in their home country according to the 3 previous goals and discussed regional strategy.
- According to previous actions, the 3D regional Focal point will help set-up of the local 3D program and provide the appropriate training to local team.
- Will actively contribute to the support of the local patient treatment. (tele-expertise/medicine)
- In the case of the set-up of a complete 3D program is locally partially/temporary/indefinitely impossible, the 3D regional focal point can identify innovative solution to treat local patients (based on priorly defined criteria) with known regional capabilities.

5. Provide clinical and technical support to local teams admitting patients from 3D programs, in collaboration with the technical and clinical coordinators of The MSF Foundation 3D project.
- The support provided will be technical (3D technology and processes) and clinical (rehabilitation standards, tele-expertise and tele-medicine to requested patients)
- The 3D regional position will set up and coordinate potentially needed training in the field.

6. Coordinate the data collection of the 3D program at the regional level.
- The 3D regional focal point will be responsible for the collection and centralization of regional clinical and technical data in an appropriate reporting format.

7. Document clinical and technical guidance, standards and protocols for the 3D regional program with the support of MSF the foundation Coordinators.

8. Ensure the digital security and protection of 3D patients in the Middle East.
- The 3D regional focal point will be responsible for digital security of patient information by supporting and ensuring the good practice of data security usage in the field (e.g. appropriate use of SharePoint and communications channels)

9. Participate in field, regional and Foundation meetings and write regular reports on the 3D regional activity.

Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 2.5 million accommodations globally.

We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

Get to Know our Team:

In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Aerospike, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.

Do full stack engineering: you should have solid experience in all parts of the technology stack: infrastructure, client side, back end, performance, data, and others.
Developing people – Despite our investment and belief in technology, people are still our greatest asset. The right candidate will have a keen interest in developing people: inspiring those around them so they can achieve their potential. Being able to bring A-players such as yourself from outside and integrating them into the business will also be important.

What you’ll Need to Succeed:

Extremely proficient in at least 1 programming language (Java, Scala, C#)
Strong experience in systems architecture – particularly in complex, scalable and fault tolerant distributed systems
Demonstrable experience as a system owner with operational responsibility
Proficient in lower level engineering (Garbage collection, context switching, threading)

Good understanding of application security
Passionate about technology and the Internet
Must have worked in a successful agile development team
Must have run engineering teams before with 5+ direct reports
Able to operate with autonomously: making decisions, setting KPIs, with a strong sense of ownership

COVID-19 Considerations

In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice.

In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard.

Corporate Security Responsibility

Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and
Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

Job Description

Hi! We’re Oscer.

We are building the tools to eliminate missed diagnosis, starting with our education product to train the world’s best clinicians.

In just one year we’ve created the world’s best virtual patients and worked with some of the world’s best institutions. Blackbird Ventures, who invested in us, put us among the most innovative healthcare companies in their portfolio.

We're eliminating missed diagnosis because patients deserve better

Our founder, Dr. Thomas Kelly (Tom) had hundreds of experiences as a junior doctor where patients had incorrect, delayed or missed diagnoses causing stress, harm and even death. With his background in mathematics and interest in deep learning the idea for Oscer was born to eliminate missed diagnosis. We have been inspired by fundamentally new paradigms in deep learning like AlphaZero to build a truly superhuman clinical AI that will outperform the existing gold standards and a completely reconfigured workflow for doctors to provide care to patients.

What you see today in education is a stepping stone, a product that has allowed us to start building our medical knowledge graph that maps inquiries (when did your chest pain start?) to the relevant conditions (heart attack) and presentations (chest pain) in adult medicine. This knowledge graph forms the basis of our virtual patient interactions and with every conversation from our students we’re strengthening our understanding of doctor-patient interactions.

Job Description
We are looking for a Senior Mobile Software Engineer to join our growing Engineering Team. You will lead the development of our first mobile applications, bringing our core AI models into the hands of our users. You’ll be our first dedicated mobile engineer getting hands on in the code but also zooming out to set the right infrastructure for the junior engineers that will work with you.
Do you have a knack for creating beautiful mobile experiences?
Have you shocked designers with your attention to detail and intuitive code?
Do you leave other engineers asking “How did you build that so quickly”?
What you'll do:
Define the architecture for mobile application development at the company
Take our first mobile app from idea to live in the app store
Work closely with our design team to deliver pixel perfection
What we'll look for:
Expert level in React Native or convince us to use your preferred framework
Super strong coding skills and problem oriented thinking
Detailed knowledge in best practice software design and mobile application architecture
Familiarity with common testing practices
Experience submitting applications to App Stores on iOS & Android
Fluency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Experience using REST API integrations in mobile apps
We'd love it if you:
Are a combo designer & engineer with a picky aesthetic
Have worked with microservice architectures before
Want to work in a startup environment where your work is directly linked to our success
Have a true passion for our mission to eliminate missed diagnosis in the world
What do we believe in ?
We create unconventional solutions to difficult problems and we build them fast. We want you to set impossible goals and make them happen, think landing a rocket but the medical version. You'll be surrounded by a world class team of engineers, medicos and designers to do your best work, inspired by our shared beliefs:
We will stop at nothing to improve patient care across the world
We design user experiences filled with joy and ship them fast
We make decisions in a flat hierarchy that prioritises the truth over position
We provide the resources for people to succeed and give them the freedom to do it
Why you will flourish with us ?
We will set you up for success from day one, ensuring that your career will flourish.
Come in at the beginning of one of the most innovative startups in the world with less than 20 people.
Experience the immediate impact of your work with our users.
Learn from some of the best engineers, marketers and creatives, joining a diverse team from Nura, Sportsbet, Pepperstone, Goldman, KPMG, IBM.
Become an owner, with shares (equity) in the company, if Oscer wins, we all win.
Help us eliminate missed diagnosis !
We’re going to need the strongest among you"
